    A word is defined as a sequence of characters separated by spaces.
    
    If a word starts with a non-letter character, the first letter after 
    that character is capitalized instead, and the non-letter character at
    the start of the word is left unchanged.

    Parameters
    ----------
    s : str
        The input string.

    Returns
    -------
    str
        A new string where the first letter of each word is uppercased
        and all other letters are unchanged.
